As a one-man project, things usually tend to move slowly, but thankfully there are amazing people out there with a keen eye and generous heart proving open-source is the best way for software development!

## Version is now properly reported on audit log

Since the last release, Penna ships with a single audit log in cases of everything working out successfully, in which it reports which version it's using for runtime. This is helpful to debug any unintended behavior, for example, in cases where library versions might clash and cause a classpath issue - though usually this shouldn't happen if you bundle Penna as a runtime-only dependency for your application.

Anyway, previously, however, this was broken due to an issue with how the JAR was packaged and this was spotted and fixed by the fantastic [Mark Sailes](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mark-sailes/). Thanks a lot!

## Final words

This is a small release but hopefully a very meaningful one as I feel Penna is reaching a point where it is no longer too experimental and can be used in production. As always, feel free to reach out in any way if you have any issues or questions and all sorts of feedback are very welcome.

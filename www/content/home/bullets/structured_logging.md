Logging is supposed to provide meaningful information and, with the evolution of log processing platforms,
it is oftentimes difficult to convey the right information as written, natural text, in a way that it
both makes sense for humans and is easy for machines to process.

Instead, we should embrace the notion that logs are effectively data and should be treated as such.
